<h1>WiSE 2025 Mentorship and Networking Night </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
WiSE (Women in Science and Engineering) is a student-led initiative dedicated to promoting equity, representation, and professional development opportunities for women and underrepresented groups in STEM. The organization aims to foster mentorship, build community, and create accessible networking spaces that empower students to thrive in technical fields.

For WiSE 2025, an event attended by over 100 participants, I served on the Supplies Committee and supported multiple aspects of event planning and execution. I assisted in preparing presentation materials, including PowerPoint decks used during the event, and helped coordinate logistics to ensure smooth operations.

In addition, I contributed to securing local sponsorships by reaching out to companies and building professional partnerships to support the event. I also assisted with participant registration and on-site coordination, helping create an organized and welcoming experience for attendees.

Through this experience, I developed skills in event coordination, stakeholder communication, sponsorship outreach, and collaborative leadership within a large-scale student initiative.
